# Enhancing Security Measures for Mommas and Pappas Farm Co-op's

## Project Overview

### Introduction
This project focuses on enhancing the security posture of Mommas and Pappas Farm Co-op, a cooperative of farmers in the Midwest United States. The co-op recently expanded its operations by acquiring a credit union and a check-cashing business, both of which presented significant security challenges. Our task was to implement industry best practices and align our security policies with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks to mitigate risks and ensure compliance.

### Objective
The primary objective was to secure the co-op's new financial ventures by addressing internal and external threats, improving cash handling practices, and ensuring regulatory compliance. This involved developing comprehensive security policies, conducting risk assessments, and implementing training programs for employees.

### Scenario
Mommas and Pappas Farm Co-op is a group of farmers in the Midwest United States who formed a co-op five years ago to pool their resources. The co-op owns a centralized packaging and freezing center to pack and ship harvested crops for the co-op owners. The co-op recently purchased a credit union to allow them to pay their employees directly and offer the benefits of credit union membership to their employees. The credit union was purchased at a bargain rate because they recently failed their capital stress test, made some loans that are in default, and had to fire a group of branch managers who stole cash by falsifying cash receipt reports.

Farmers usually employ seasonal labor that does not want to establish a credit union account. This presented a challenge to the co-op members who do not want to have the liability of keeping large amounts of cash on the farm to pay this type of seasonal employee. So, the co-op just bought a check-cashing business with ten branches. The deal for the check-cashing business will close in two weeks. It should be noted that the check-cashing business has “misplaced” some cash, and has had two recent break-ins which resulted in over $500,000 of cash stolen. Your team has been hired to act as the security team for the farm co-op’s current and future check-cashing businesses.

## Project Document

### Executive Summary
The acquisition of the check-cashing business and the credit union by Mommas and Pappas Farm Co-op introduced several urgent issues that needed immediate attention. This document outlines the recommended best practices and suggestions aligned with industry standards and specific NIST frameworks.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

### Security Policy and Training
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations)**
  - **AT-1 Security Awareness and Training Policy and Procedures**
  - **AT-2 Security Awareness Training**

We developed security policies to address internal risks and implemented regular security training sessions for all employees. This helps in educating the workforce and reducing the risk of internal threats.

### Cash Mismanagement
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-53**
  - **AC-2 Account Management**
  - **CP-9 Information System Backup**

Stringent cash handling practices were put in place, including the separation of duties and regular audits. This minimizes the risk of cash mismanagement and ensures accountability.

### Failure to Cover Cash Obligations
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-30 (Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments)**
  - **RA-5 Vulnerability Scanning**

To address financial obligations, we explored liquidating non-capital assets and conducted regular financial audits and stress tests to ensure compliance and stability.

### Defaulted Loans
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-53**
  - **RA-3 Risk Assessment**

We considered renegotiating loans for better terms and established procedures for the repossession of assets only as a last resort.

### Failure to Keep Correct Cash Receipts
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-53**
  - **AU-2 Audit Events**

Proper documentation and rigorous training for new managers on cash receipt handling were implemented, along with a system of checks and balances.

### Employee Background Checks
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-53**
  - **PS-3 Personnel Screening**

Regular background checks for employees were conducted, and hiring policies and training practices were reviewed to create less incentive for any wrongdoing.

### Surveillance and Data Preservation
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-53**
  - **SI-12 Information Management and Retention**

Upgraded surveillance systems were installed, and offsite tape backups were implemented to ensure data preservation and security.

### Unfit Employee Hiring
**NIST Frameworks Used:**
- **NIST SP 800-53**
  - **PS-3 Personnel Screening**

A new hiring policy emphasizing qualifications and professional background was implemented to eliminate nepotistic hires.
